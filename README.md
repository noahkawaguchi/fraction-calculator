# Fraction Calculator

### ðŸ”— [Live link here](https://noahkawaguchi.github.io/fraction-calculator/)

I often find myself wishing I could work with fractions directly in a calculator instead of nesting sets of parentheses or performing intermediate calculations only to end up with an imprecise decimal representation of the answer. I sometimes use the calculators on [calculatorsoup.com](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/), but I thought it would be good practice to build my own. 

This is a basic frontend-only project through which I work on the following skills:

- Writing TypeScript, HTML, and CSS without a framework like React
- Setting up a project with pnpm and Vite
- Integrating [fraction.js](https://github.com/rawify/Fraction.js) and [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX)
- Testing with Jest and Testing Library
