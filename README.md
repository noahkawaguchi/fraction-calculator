# Fraction Calculator

I often find myself wishing I could work with fractions directly in a calculator instead of nesting sets of parentheses or performing intermediate calculations only to end up with an imprecise decimal representation of the answer.

This is a basic frontend-only project through which I practice the following:

- TypeScript, HTML, and CSS without using a framework like React
- Project setup with NPM and Vite
- [fraction.js](https://github.com/rawify/Fraction.js) and [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX)
- Testing with Jest and Testing Library
